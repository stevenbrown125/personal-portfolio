## Dobry wieczór!

Why is learning a language so difficult? Well, for many of us it will require us to learn in a way that we’ve never had to before. Cramming the night before a test and brain dumping the next day is not going to work when it comes to language acquisition. Once you learn a new word or phrase, ideally, you’re able to recall it at any moment. You’re held accountable for all the words you learn from day one until they are engrained into your memory.

_So how do you do that?_

Well, we’ll get to that soon, but first let’s talk about brain plasticity. _Brain plasticity_, as defined by the neurologist Dr. Judy Willis, is how our brain organizes and / or compartments information, so it can retrieve it later as part of ideas or thoughts [1]. This means that every single activity we experience, we are learning from it, and making new connections inside of our brain. More precisely, in response to everything we do, groups of neurons are being fire together and building new neural pathways. When we are young, our brains are malleable and not fully formed which allows for a lot of flexibility and plasticity. This explains why children learn so quickly (both in language, and otherwise).

Deborah Ancona, Seley Distinguished Professor of Management at MIT goes on to explain that as we grow older, the neural pathways become more and more embedded and move to deeper parts of the brain [2]. Tara Swart, a senior lecturer at MIT, in her book _Neuroscience for Leadership_, says this is because our brains are “inherently lazy” and always choose the most energy efficient path if we let it[2]. abnf

_The good news is that it’s not too late to restructure your neural pathways._

One way to do this is ( you guessed it! ) learning a new language. Restructuring neural pathways is exhausting work and you will feel it both mentally and physically because your focusing on using parts of your brain in ways it’s not accustomed to. Understandably so, these new connections and pathways are fragile right off the bat and can only be improved through repetition and practice. It can take months to develop a new brain map. During this time, you will have to rely on motivation, willpower, and self-control to achieve your goal.

There’s a lot more information out there about neural plasticity. I just wanted to introduce you to the concepts so you understand the challenges in front of you. If you’re interested in this topic I encourage you to conduct additional research and share your findings! I’ve provided some optional readings below that I found interesting. Also note that the links in the post are just for citation purposes and are not required reading (I also haven’t read Tara Swart’s book _Neurosciences for Leadership_, but I did find several references to what she said in it)

## Further reading _(optional, but recommended)_

This article by Dr. Judy Willis elaborates in further details how your brain processes new information and gives insight on how to improve your brain’s learning receptiveness by understanding yourself and your environment.

This article provides TONS of different research in regards to neural plasticity and its effects on language acquisitions, music training, and life! I wouldn’t read the whole thing line by line but you can jump around a bit and see what type of effects learning music and language have on the brain
