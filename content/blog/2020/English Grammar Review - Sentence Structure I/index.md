##Witam!

Welcome to your first lesson of English Review. When we start studying Polish Grammar, you will see most (if not all) these concepts come up again. The better you understand English grammar, the easier it will be for you to understand Polish grammar.Without further ado, let’s talk about sentence structure.English sentences are comprised of two parts, the **subject** and the **predicate**.

The **subject** is the person or thing that acts or is being described in the sentence. The **predicate** is the action or the description itself. To have a complete sentence, you need both the subject and the predicate.

Often times (but not always) there is an object that follows the verb. A **direct object** is the thing that is receiving the action of the verb and answers the question 'What?' or 'Who?'. An **indirect object** is the recipient of the direct object and answers the question 'To whom?' or 'For whom?'.

For example: "John gave Jeff the keys"

- John is the subject.
- Gave is the verb
- Keys is the direct object (gave what?)
- Jeff is the indirect object (to whom?)

It is worth noting that just because the predicate contains a verb does not mean the words ‘verb’ and ‘predicate’ are interchangeable. Without getting too deep in the weeds, the simple predicate (in English) is the verb that tells us what specific action the subject is taking, and the complete predicate includes other modifiers of the sentence (including the direct object, clauses and/or phrases).

For example, in the sentence “Many beautiful flowers grow in the woods”

- the subject is ‘flowers’
- the simple predicate is the verb ‘grow’
- and the complete predicate is ‘grow in the woods’.

In English, you will only ever find this sentence structure - Subject Verb (Object). Polish on the other hand, can have mixed word order (to some extent). More often than not, you will see the sentence structure similar to that of English (subject verb (object)) but it is possible to move words around to change the emphasis.

For example, _Alicja ma kota_ ("Alice has a cat") is the standard order (Subject Verb Object). This sentence can be changed to - _Alicja kota ma_, with emphasis on ma ("has") emphasizing t**he ownership** of the cat by Alice (Subject Object Verb). Or even _kota ma Alicja_, which emphasizes that **Alice** is the one who has the cat (Object Verb Subject). Once again, the most natural sounding Polish will come in the Subject Object Predicate form but you will come across mixed word order when special emphasis is being made.

Modifiers such as adjectives, adverbs, negation, etc. always stay next to the word they are modifying. Fun fact, have you ever noticed there is a correct adjective word order in English? Like we wouldn’t say “We have orange medium five round pumpkins” (that hurt just writing), we say “We have five medium round orange pumpkins” (phew, okay you’ve probably never said that but anyways…) The correct order of adjectives in English is as follows:

- Opinion: pretty, horrible, lovely
- Size: huge, tiny, big, little
- Age: old, young, new
- Shape: round, square, triangular
- Color: black, red, yellow
- Origin: British, Chinese, French
- Material: woolen, wooden, silk
- Purpose: writing (paper), school (shoes)

Since we’re talking about adjectives, in Polish you may see the adjective come after the noun it modifies. These instances are usually in fixed expressions and official names. Can you believe you’ve already seen that? (_dzień dobry_ - Day good, also known as good day or hello, and it’s noun adjective!)
