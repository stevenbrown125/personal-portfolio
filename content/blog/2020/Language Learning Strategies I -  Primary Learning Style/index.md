## Cześć!

What’s the best way to learn a language? It’s impossible to say because the way we learn languages is different for everyone. Some people just naturally pick up the language while others (including me) have to work at it every day. In this section, I’ll be presenting several different language learning methods that are geared towards specific learning styles. Part of learning a language is knowing what your strengths and weakness are so you can address them early. With that being said, the first step to knowing thy self is identifying your preferred learning style.

If you already know, that’s great! If you don’t, I’ve attached a PDF with the [Barsch Learning Style Index](./Conduct_BarschInventory.pdf) which is a test to determine your primary learning style.

For me, I’m a visual learner and what helps me retain vocabulary is the use of flashcards and a lot of repetition. I’ve always struggled with listening (my mom can vouch for that) and I often have to visualize the word in my head to even pronounce it correctly. What really helps me is listening to target language news and music while following along with the transcript. That way I can focus on hearing each individual word and try to commit it to memory.

What about you? What’s your primary learning style? What challenges do you foresee yourself having and how do you think you can overcome them?
