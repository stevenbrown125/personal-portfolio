## Preface

This is a research paper that I wrote for Full Sail University.

## What two (2) companies did you research that use Agile?

I researched two companies which use the Agile Methodology and they are Adobe and Spotify. Agile is a feedback intensive development methodology that is based on an  incremental and iterative approach and is adaptable to changing requirements over time ("What's the Difference? Agile vs Scrum vs Waterfall vs Kanban", 2016). Adobe is a  technology company that creates and develops software for use by media professionals  across multiple disciplines. On the other hand, Spotify is a streaming service that gives  its users access to a variety of music, podcasts and videos. Both of these companies  have seen tremendous success that can be directly attributed to use of Agile  methodologies.

The big shift towards Agile at Adobe was led by Peter Green and started around  2005 (Ham, 2015). At this time, Adobe flagship products like Premiere Pro and  Photoshop were only available on the Windows Operating System and with the recent  acquisition of Macromedia, Adobe needed a game plan moving forward. In 2005, two  teams at Adobe began using the Scrum Framework which is a subset of the Agile  Methodology (Green & Smith, 2009). As this innovative approach gained steam, more  and more of Adobe’s products hopped on board and today over 1/3 of the developers at  Adobe are using Scrum (Green, 2017). The use of Agile helped facilitate the  transformation of various desktop applications to the subscription based Adobe Creative  Cloud launching Adobe back to the forefront of media design companies.

Spotify has made quite an impact on the Agile Community by being a prime  example of how proper execution of the Agile Methodology can lead to rapid success.  Founded in 2006, Spotify originally adopted the Scrum Framework as their primary  Agile methodology. However, as the company grew in size with more complex  demands, Spotify decided to create their own Agile Framework which was influenced by  the values held by the company (Erikkson, 2015). The framework they created allowed  the company to successfully scale their Agile methodology and maintain their  competitiveness in the market. Additionally, the framework allowed for autonomy while  still being aligned towards the common company mission, leading to the internal motto  of “Be autonomous, but don’t sub optimize” ("Spotify and Its Strong Engineering  Culture", 2014). The fact that Spotify has been able to compete against industry giants  such as Apple, Amazon, and Google is a clear testament to the power of Agile when  implemented and practiced correctly.

## What is the most popular software being utilized by companies who utilize Agile?

After reviewing multiple sources and companies, I’ve found that Wrike is amongst the top, if not the most popular, software that is utilized by companies that use the Agile  Methodologies. Wrike is a work management and collaboration platform that is used by

over 15,000 organizations with millions of users in 130 different countries (Chowdhry,  2017). Wrike serves as a one-stop shop and has proven to be more flexible than its competition. Companies such as Paypal, Uber, and Airbnb all use Wrike for their project  management needs (Konrad, 2013; Rogers, 2014). Not only is Wrike one of the most  popular software solutions for Agile Methodology users, it is also growing at a rapid  pace. This growth can be linked to the success major companies have seen using  Wrike. Airbnb is a great example of Agile utilized correctly considering it has been able  to successfully disrupt the hotel business without owning a single hotel (Moth, 2014).  When Airbnb released it’s ‘Experiences’ feature, it was unprepared for the scalability  and traffic demand that came with it. After being introduced to Wrike at an Adobe  conference, Airbnb began using the software and was able to streamline and scale their  workflow as well as increase their capacity and speed all while decreasing costs (Goh,  2017). As Wrike continues to add features and optimize their software, we can expect to  see their continued success in the future.

## Why do you believe Agile is trending in the industry as the preferred project  methodology?

I believe that Agile is trending in the industry as the preferred project  methodology because of the attractiveness of the principles behind it as well as the  research and evidence that the Agile Methodology, if utilized correctly, produces results.  The fundamentals behind Agile are simple, straightforward, and cultivate an  environment dependent on teamwork, communication, and results. The technology  industry is moving at an incredible pace, and the adaptability of the Agile Methodology  allows for businesses to adjust to ever changing requirements and demands. Both  Spotify and Adobe are great examples of the results Agile can produce but there are  countless others who have successfully implemented the methodology into their  businesses.

Comprehension of the Agile Life Cycle is essential for understanding why the  Agile Methodology is prevalent in today’s industry. The Agile Life Cycle is broken down  into five states: Envision, Speculate, Explore, Adapt, and Close (Ogunsina, 2013). The  Envision stage maps out the foundation and the scope of the project objectives. Next,  the Speculate, Explore, and Adapt stages work in iterations called Sprints with each  iteration lasting on average 1 to 4 weeks (Cohn, 2006). During the speculate stage, the  stakeholders and development teams determine the features of the iteration as well as  their priority. The Explore phase is essentially the meat and potatoes of the life cycle,  where the development of the features takes place. At the end of the Explore phase,  comes the Adapt phase which covers the lessons learned from the Sprint and confirms  with the customer that everything is working as expected. Finally, after the last Sprint  iteration, it is time to close the project which consists of payment reconciliation and  redeployment of personal as well as an overarching lesson learned. The important thing  to note about this life cycle is how it is heavily dependent on communication, both  between team members and with the customer in the form of feedback, as well as it’s  adaptability, with the start of each Sprint determining the needs and priority of the  features to be developed. Additionally, the continual updates that are provided to the  customer keeps them happy, as well as determines any changes in requirements that needs to take place as soon as possible. As I mentioned before, the technology industry  is moving at a rapid pace, and historically, businesses who cannot adapt go bankrupt (Boss, 2015). By embodying the need for adaptation, Agile has successfully become a  must have in any project management philosophy now, and in the foreseeable future.
