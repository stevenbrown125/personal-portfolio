##Dzień dobry!

Great job taking the first step to learning Polish! The journey will be long and difficult but I’m hopeful that having a small group struggling together will help keep us motivated. To start things out, I will lay out the different applications we will be using so you can get set up.

Initially we will be using [Mondly](https://www.mondly.com/) which is a language learning app. These types of apps are useful because you will have the opportunity to see, hear, and write polish vocabulary. If you can afford it, you will need to purchase the premium account for Mondly which will grant you unlimited access. They often have sales so if they don't it's fine to wait until the holidays (i.e. black friday).

I recommend Mondly over other language learning apps because you have the option to learn a language _in a different language_ which I would 100% recommend doing if you already have a second language! Learning a language using your second language not only solidifies your second language skill level, but also discourages your new language from combatting with your second language for that number two spot.

Additionally, we will be using [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/) to study and review vocabulary and I recommend making a basic account. You will also need a [Google account](https://www.google.com/account/about/) (you can sign up for free) because eventually you will be writing compositions in Polish via [Google Docs](https://www.google.com/docs/about/).

Finally I recommend [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) or [YouTube](https://music.youtube.com/) for music. If you find some time, try to search and build a playlist with music you like. The exposure to Polish will start to tune your ears to the language even if you don’t know what they are saying. Also, you’ll find that as we progress you’ll start to pick out words, then phrases, then sentences that you understand.

To recap heres a list:

- [Mondly](https://www.mondly.com/)
- [Quizlet](https://quizlet.com/)
- [Google account](https://www.google.com/account/about/)
- [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/us/) or [YouTube](https://music.youtube.com/)

The course will be laid out as follows:

This first section will start by reviewing English Grammar and discussing language learning strategies. Polish Grammar is very difficult, especially coming from English, so it’s important to have a solid understanding of English grammar before we begin. As we review, we’ll look to see how the rules are applied in Polish. During this first section please download the apps listed above. You can start working through the Mondly lessons as well. When you’re doing the lessons, practice saying the words out loud each time (even if you’re not required to do so).

In the next section we will start to cover the alphabet. During this time we will also be practicing handwriting the polish vocabulary we learned in section One. Language is a perishable skill so a lot of this will fall on you to look for ways to immerse yourself. I hope you are as excited to learn Polish as I am! Attitude plays a huge factor in how receptive you are to the language.Keep in mind I’m also a student in this study so feel free to post helpful resources that you find that are pertinent to things we are working on!

Don’t hesitate to reach out with any questions comments or concerns you have as well.

_Na Zdrowie!_
