#Dzień dobry!

Great job taking the first step to learning Polish! The journey will be long and difficult but I’m hopeful that having a small group struggling together will help keep us motivated. To start things out, I will layout the different applications we will be using so you can get set up.

Initially we will be using Mondly which is a language learning app. These types of apps are nice because you will have the opportunity to see, hear, and write polish vocabulary. If you can afford it, you will need to purchase the premium account for Mondly which will grant you unlimited access. They often have sales so if they don't it's fine to wait until the holidays (i.e. black friday). 

Additionally, we will be using Quizlet to study and review vocabulary, I recommend making a basic account. You will also need a Google account (you can sign up for free) because eventually you will be writing compositions in Polish via Google Docs. 

Finally I recommend Spotify or YouTube for music. If you find some time, try to search and build a playlist with music you like. The exposure to Polish will start to tune your ears to the language even if you don’t know what they are saying. Also, you’ll find that as we progress you’ll start to pick out words, then phrases, then sentences that you understand.

To recap heres a list:

- Mondly
- Quizlet
- Google Account
- Spotify or YouTube Music

The course will be laid out as follows:

This first week we will start by reviewing English Grammar and discussing language learning strategies. Polish Grammar is very difficult, especially coming from English, so it’s important to have a solid understanding of English grammar before we begin. As we review, we’ll look to see how the rules are applied in Polish. During this first week please download the apps listed above. You can start working through the Mondly lessons as well. Let’s shoot to be done with the first ‘Welcome’ module by next Sunday (that’s one lesson a day). When you’re doing the lessons, practice saying the words out loud each time (even if you’re not required to do so). 

Next week we will start to cover the alphabet. This will take us about two, possibly three weeks. During this time we will also be practicing handwriting the polish vocabulary we learned in week one. After we have the alphabet down, we will reassess what level we are at and decide how to move forward. For speaking practice we will pair up at least once a week for a 30 minute session. I’ll be providing role-plays the incorporate the vocabulary we’ve learned. This is when you’ll have the opportunity to read/memorize your compositions. Language is a perishable skill so a lot of this will fall on you to look for ways to immerse yourself. I hope you are as excited to learn Polish as I am! Attitude plays a huge factor in how receptive you are to the language.Keep in mind I’m also a student in this study so feel free to post helpful resources that you find that are pertinent to things we are working on!

Don’t hesitate to post any questions comments or concerns you have as well.

*Na Zdrowie!*
