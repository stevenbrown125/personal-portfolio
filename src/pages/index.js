            . Web Design &amp; Development is my passion and I love working with
            Javascript. I usually code using ReactJS and NodeJS while utilizing
            the NextJS or GatsbyJS Frameworks. My goal throughout this next year
            is to build on my current knowledge of TypeScript and working with
            the GraphQL API. I also enjoy studying Russian{" "}

            and am developing applications for language acquisition. To do this,
            I dive into the world of neuroscience and attempt to find ways to
            increase productivity in processes. Oh, and I love to travel and
            write so check out my blog to see some of my latest adventures!

            I believe in being part of something bigger than myself so let me

            using GatsbyJS, Markdown, GraphQL, and Styled Components. It is
            meant to serve as a place to display all my works and as a
            playground as I explore GatsbyJS and GraphQL in more depth. I hope
            you like it!
