            I'm a Full Stack Javascript developer from the US
            <span role="img" aria-label="american-flag"></span>. Web Design
            &amp; Development is my passion and I love working with Javascript.
            I usually code using ReactJS and NodeJS while utilizing the NextJS
            or GatsbyJS Frameworks. My goal throughout this next year is to
            deepen my knowledge of TypeScript and understanding of the GraphQL
            API. I also enjoy studying Russian
            <span role="img" aria-label="russian-flag"></span> and am developing
            applications for language acquisition. While doing this, I dive into
            the world of neuroscience and attempt to find ways to increase
            productivity in processes. Oh, and I love to travel and write so
            check out my blog to see some of my latest adventures!

            I believe in being part of something bigger than myself so let's
            work together! If you are interested in my professional skills, take

            using GatsbyJS, Markdown, GraphQL, and Styled Components. It is
            meant to serve as a place to display all my works and as a
            playground as I explore GatsbyJS and GraphQL in more depth. I built
            this site off of GatsbyJS Blog and have published it's source code
            on{" "}
