## Halo!

In this post I would like to direct your attention to another nuance in the Polish language because you will see this concept very soon as you progress through the Mondly lessons. Polish is a ‘Pro-drop language’ (pronoun dropping) which means, often times, pronouns can be omitted when they can be inferred by context or by grammar. Much like other foreign languages, verbs are conjugated into different forms based on what the subject is ( with consideration to: gender, number, and tense). 

For example, a sentence like *“Ty pijesz herbate?”* ( are you drinking tea?) can be changed to *“Pijesz herbate?”* Both are grammatically correct and mean the same thing. You will see the second form very often so be on the lookout!
