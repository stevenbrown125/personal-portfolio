  Steven Brown's Portfolio Website
</h1>

I built this site off of the Gatsby's blog start boiler plate. This was my first GatsbyJS project and I learned a lot of things along the way (and I still am). I know this site isn't perfect and there are plenty of places for improvement (background image processing? ouch!). I will continue to update this site and repo with my latest source code. I plan to continue to add functionality and use this site as a sort of GatsbyJS playground.

Feel free to make any corrections. All my blog posts are written in Markdown with minimal HTML (more coming soon!).
